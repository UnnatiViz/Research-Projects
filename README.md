# Gender Differences in Coping Strategies to Occupational Stressors - Teaching Professors

## Project Overview
This project examines gender differences in occupational stress and coping strategies among professors. The research focuses on whether female professors experience more stress than their male counterparts and how gender influences the choice of coping strategies. The study also explores correlations between specific stressors and coping mechanisms.

## Research Aim and Objectives
- Investigate gender differences in occupational stress and coping strategies.
- Identify coping strategies utilized by male and female professors.
- Examine the role of marital status, age, years of experience, and family type in coping strategies.
- Explore correlations between stressors and coping mechanisms.

---

## Methodology
- **Sample**: 30 professors (15 males, 15 females) from two colleges in Mumbai.
- **Tools**:
  - *Organizational Role Stress (ORS) Scale*: Measures stressors like role stagnation, role ambiguity, and resource inadequacy.
  - *Ways of Coping Scale*: Assesses coping strategies like confrontative coping, distancing, and positive reappraisal.
- **Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, MANOVA, and Pearson correlation.

---

## Key Findings
- No significant gender differences in occupational stress and coping strategies overall.
- Positive correlations between specific stressors and coping mechanisms:
  - **Role stagnation** correlates with seeking social support and planful problem-solving.
  - **Role expectation conflict** correlates with seeking social support.
  - **Personal inadequacy** correlates with self-control.
  - **Role ambiguity** correlates with self-control and escape avoidance.

## Conclusion
While no significant overall gender differences were found, the study highlights nuanced correlations between stressors and coping strategies. These findings underline the importance of tailored interventions to address occupational stress.


---

## Future Improvements
- Increase sample size for better generalizability.
- Incorporate parametric inferential statistics to strengthen findings.
- Explore variations across different academic streams.
